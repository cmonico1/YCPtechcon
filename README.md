# DevCon Website

Semester long responsive Web Design 2 project. Created in Spring 2019 the site is for a fictitious tech conference that was hand coded using HTML, CSS, and jQuery. All assets except for body copy and images were created by me including the logo, hero image motion graphic, and the "Where Is DevCon?" Map.
